## Description

I crafted an in-depth report using Power BI, incorporating four graphs to visually represent 2013 financial data associated with various products, alongside an interactive feature enabling users to click on a specific product and alter the report to display relevant data for that chosen product. In the right corner, I also added the profit for the year 2013.

### Monthly units sold 

The "Monthly Units Sold" graph is crucial as it provides a visual representation of the sales performance throughout September, October, November, and December, offering valuable insights into the product's market dynamics and performance trends over the last quarter of the year.

***

### Profit by Product

The "Profit by Product" graph holds importance as it presents a clear overview of the individual contribution of each product to the company's overall profit in 2013. This information is vital for decision-making, allowing stakeholders to identify top-performing products and areas for potential improvement.

***

### Country's Profit by Month 

The "Country Profit by Month" graph is important because it gives a visual breakdown of how much profit each country contributed each month. This helps in understanding the geographical variations in profitability over time, aiding in strategic decisions related to market focus, resource allocation, and identifying trends in international performance.

### Data Table 

This table is important because it provides a complete snapshot of critical financial details, including country-specific and product-specific information such as profit, sales price, units sold, and total sales. Having all this data in one table allows for quick analysis and informed decision-making.
